# reverse-singly-linked-list

## About 

This project is a very simple basic implementation of a SinglyLinkedList which 
has an very concise API:

- `add(node)`: add a new node to the end of the list.
- `reverse()`: reverse the list in-place.

## Getting started

Install project dependencies (mostly dev dependencies) via:

```
npm install
```

Then run tests via:

```
npm run test
```

As of now there's one test file which is testing SinglyLinkedList public APIs.
